SMU Homework Week 14 - Interactive Webpage on Belly Button Dataset

My code creates an interactive webpage that allows you to view visualizations of the belly button data. The visualizations update when a new person is chosen from the dropdown.

I had help from Prof. Booth during office hours to help create the code. 

The dataset comes from this link: https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/
