SMU Homework Week 14 - Interactive Webpage on Belly Button Dataset

My code creates an interactive webpage that allows you to view visualizations of the belly button data. The visualizations update when a new person is chosen from the dropdown.

Please visit this page to view the dashboard: https://allyb3.github.io/interactive_webpage_14/

The dataset comes from this link: https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/
